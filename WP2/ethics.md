# Ethics in Real-Time & Real Data at NGOSTI

In **NGOSTI**, students will often deal with live systems, dynamic events, or
real data flows, misconfigured systems or malicious attacks. It is critical
to behave **ethically and responsibly** in such contexts. Below are key
principles and expectations.

## Guiding Principles

1. **Respect confidentiality and privacy**
   Only access and use data that you are explicitly authorized to see.
   Do not expose or share sensitive information unless permission is granted
   or required by law.

2. **Act with integrity and trustworthiness**
   Be honest about what you observe. Avoid misleading or false claims.

3. **Coordinate vulnerability disclosure responsibly**
   If you uncover a security flaw or vulnerability, follow a coordinated
   disclosure path rather than publishing or exploiting it recklessly.

4. **Be evidence-based and transparent**
   Base your conclusions and reports on verifiable facts.
   Distinguish clearly between observed data, hypotheses, and speculation.

5. **Respect jurisdictional and legal boundaries**
   Real systems may span multiple legal domains.
   You must abide by relevant laws, data protection rules, and local
   regulations.

6. **Maintain team health and capacity**
   Work sustainably and ethically.
   Do not let pressure or overload push you into unethical shortcuts.

7. **Limit data collection to what is necessary**
   Gather only as much as needed for investigation or analysis.
   Discard extraneous data that serves no legitimate purpose.

8. **Uphold human rights and fairness**
   Be mindful of unintended collateral impacts on individuals (e.g., privacy
   violations, bias). Do not discriminate in your actions or analysis.

These principles align with the
[**EthicsfIRST: Ethics for Incident Response and Security Teams**]
(https://www.first.org/global/sigs/ethics/ethics-first)
framework developed by **FIRST**.

Whenever you face a conflict among principles or uncertainty, document the
ethical dilemma, discuss it with your peers or supervisors, and choose
the option that minimizes harm or compromise.
