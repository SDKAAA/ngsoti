# Dataset Usage Rules

These rules govern the use of datasets that are exclusively available to members of the NGSOTI consortium. 

By accessing or using these datasets, you agree to abide by the following terms:

## Consortium members access
- Only members of the NGSOTI consortium are permitted to access and use these datasets via NGSOTI-2 shares.
- All consortium users access requests to the platform will undergo a vetting process before approval or denial by the network infrastructure owner.

- Similarly, access to any NGSOTI dataset will be subject to a vetting process, with approval or rejection determined by the dataset owner.

- This evaluation process is based on an assessment of information about the requestors. Granted access may be revoked at any time based on the requestorsâ€™ activities.
- Members must not share access credentials, links, or data files with unauthorized parties.

## Usage

- Datasets are strictly for use within the scope of NGSOTI consortium projects.

## Publication

- Results of analysis can be published in TLP:CLEAR but **any references to source IP or source infrastructure must be removed from the disclosed results**.
- A specific mention of NGSOTI must be added to reference along with a reference to the EU funding.
