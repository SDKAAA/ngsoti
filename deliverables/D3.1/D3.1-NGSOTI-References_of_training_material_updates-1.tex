\section*{Deliverable definition}
The identifier of the deliverable is D3.1 and it adheres to the definition outlined in the grant agreement
written in bold. \textbf{A list of commits of in public training material git repositories}.

\section*{Executive Summary}
In the NGOSTI project, new training materials are developed, or existing ones
are updated. Some of these materials are released under an open-source license,
allowing multiple contributors from various projects to enhance and extend them.
This report focuses on NGOSTI training programs in the following three domains:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Incident Response
    \item MISP
    \item Cryptography
\end{itemize}

This report includes references to commits in the public training material
repositories.

\chapter{Training Material}

\section{Incident Response}

NGOSTI Incident Reponse training is tailored to each organization receiving the
training. Thus it includes many sensitive data about their internal working
organization and infrastructure.
A generic training was distilled and released on the NGOSTI project for this
deliverable\footnote{\url{https://github.com/ngsoti/ngsoti/tree/main/training/incident-response/NGSOTI-Incident-Response}}
It consists in 71 slides of training material.

\section{Cryptography}

Cryptography Concepts - Past and Present was designed and delivered by Georges Kesseler, IT sysadmin \& Course Manager at Digital Learning Hub of Luxembourg (DLH) as part of the NGOSTI training program for Master students. The course introduces historical and modern cryptographic methods, including substitution ciphers (Caesar, Pigpen), polyalphabetic ciphers (Vigenère), mechanical encryption (Enigma), and contemporary cryptosystems (RSA, Elliptic Curves, symmetric and asymmetric encryption). It combines conceptual foundations with practical exercises on the use of cryptography in securing digital communication. The training materials are available on the NGSOTI Github repository for this deliverable\footnote{\url{https://github.com/ngsoti/ngsoti/tree/main/training/cryptography/NGSOTI-DLH-Cryptography}}. They consist of training slides and three exercise worksheets for enryption and decryption.

\section{MISP}
The MISP open-source training materials have been developed over several years
with support from multiple funding sources and external contributors. To track
which parts were co-funded by NGOSTI, the table below lists the open-source
materials, along with their dates, training repository names, and commit IDs
to retrieve the corresponding content.
MISP plays a central role in NGSOTI by enabling integration with external
sources. Throughout 2024 and early 2025, MISP training has been expanded to
align with NGSOTI objectives. The commits listed under columns with the
repository name 'misp-training' are taken from the MISP-training GitHub
repository\footnote{\url{https://github.com/MISP/misp-training}}.


The list of commits related to trainings is shown in the table below.
