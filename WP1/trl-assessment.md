# TRL assessment of NGOSTI components

The TRLs of the NGOSTI components were assessed. The TRL definition defined in
the H2020 Workprogram 2014-2015 are used and summarized in the table below:

|TRL level | Definition |
|----------|------------|
| TRL 1    | basic principles observed |
| TRL 2    | technology concept formulated |
| TRL 3    | experimental proof of concept |
| TRL 4    | technology validated in lab   |
| TRL 5    | technology validated in relevant environment (industrially relevant environment in the case of key enabling technologies) |
| TRL 6    | technology demonstrated in relevant environment (industrially relevant environment in the case of key enabling technologies) |
| TRL 7    | system prototype demonstration in operational environment|
| TRL 8    | system complete and qualified |
| TRL 9    | actual system proven in operational environment (competitive manufacturing in the case of key enabling technologies; or in space) |

The NGOSTI components TRL assessment is shown in the table below.
