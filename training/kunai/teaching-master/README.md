## 📚 Course Overview

### Objectives
By the end of this course, students will:
- Understand the limitations of traditional antivirus software.
- Learn the importance of **context** in incident response.
- Explore the role of **endpoint visibility tools** in detecting and responding to advanced threats.
- Get an introduction to **Kunai**, a Linux monitoring tool for threat hunting.

## 🎯 Key Topics Covered

1. **How Antivirus Works (and Why It’s Not Enough)**
   - Signature-based detection.
   - Limitations against advanced threats.

2. **The Role of Context in Incident Response**
   - Why alerts without context are "just noise."
   - Building an incident timeline.

3. **Endpoint Visibility Tools**
   - What they monitor (processes, files, network activity).
   - Examples: `auditd`, `Kunai`, `Falco`, `Sysmon`.

4. **Kunai: A Linux Monitoring Tool**
   - Features: real-time event collection, JSON output, rule engine.
   - Use cases for threat hunting and incident response.

5. **Practical Considerations**
   - Logging policies, performance impact, and signal-to-noise ratio.
   - Combining AV with endpoint visibility for layered defense.
