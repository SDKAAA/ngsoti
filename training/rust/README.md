# Requirements

There is **no OS requirement** for this training so all examples should run on any OS/distribution combo.

1. Install Rust by downloading the `rustup` package of your Linux distribution or by following instructions at: https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started  
1. Install **VSCode** or **VSCodium** 
1. Install **RustAnalyzer plugin** (official rust-lang plugin): https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer
1. Clone this repository with `git clone` (so that you'll be able to refresh it easily to get all content at workshop time)
1. Open it in **VSCode**
    * Optional: `right-click` on the `README.md` file in the left panel and click on *Open Preview*
1. Navigate to [test](exercises/hello/src/main.rs)
    1. You are supposed to see a Rust `main` function with a little *play button* on top
    1. Click that *play button*
    1. You should see a bottom panel opening with the message to print
